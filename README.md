This repo shares my protocols and notebooks of ongoing work with the aim of capturing the process of science as it is happening and making it transparent and reproducible. Template for making an online notebook found [here](https://github.com/adnguyen/Notebooks_and_Protocols/blob/master/Online_notebook_template.md).

# List of Notebooks by year    

* [2018_Notebook](https://github.com/adnguyen/Notebooks_and_Protocols/blob/master/2018_notebook.md). This notebook log: 
  * dissertation projects (hsp rxn norm, range limits, proteome stability project, stressed in nature, thermal niche)
  * post doc projects (biological rhythms of *Rhagoletis*, meta-analysis of biological rhythms)
  * paper readings on biological rhythms and thermal adaptation
* [2017 Ecoological Genomics Notebook](https://github.com/adnguyen/Notebooks_and_Protocols/blob/master/2017_Eco_Gen_ANBE_nb.md). This notebook logs the activities throughout the semester    
  * I was a TA for Pbio381 at the University of Vermont, Spring 2017   
  * Check out our overall [workflow](Images/Overall_workflow_eco_genomics.html)
  * We learned: 
    * different sequencing platforms and strategies
    * population genomics- Admixture, demography
    * differential gene expression with RNA-seq
    * gene annotation with BLAST and GO
