To be a great scientist you must first become an expert at annotating….EVERYTHING. With the guidence of Andrew, a new postdoc in the Hahn Lab, I intend to become just that. If I am successful, not only will I be able to access all this important information, but I will indeed be a better scientist. This repository will be used to share my notes and protocols concerning the research I am conducting.The aim of this electronic notebook is to science as it happens.

# Project Descriptions

1. Respirometry of diapause versus non-diapause larvae; both strains
2. Total lipid extraction from Ostrinia nubilalis; both strains in diapause conditons
3. LC_ELSD analysis of tryglyceride concentration
4. GC_FID analysis of fatty acid chain identity of triglycerides
5. Undergraduate training; Erin, Jeremiah, Maggie, and Tristin
6. Instrumentation comparison between GC_FID and LC_ELSD....maybe

# 2018 Goals

1. Characterising the relationship between stored resources and diapause preparation in ECB strains UZ and BE
2. Optimize a phenotyping assay to determine if a larvae is in diapause and use that assay to sample ECB larvae (specifically BE larvae).
3. Use phenotyping assay to sample BE and UZ larvae treated for diapause
4. Extract, quantify, and identify triglycerides from all extracted larvae; both strains, both treatments, all reps.
5. Analyze all data for publishing
6. Format paper for publishing
7. Prepare for and complete M.S. exit exam by July 31st.
8. Become proficient with statistical analysis
9. Make a decision about doing a doctoral degree
